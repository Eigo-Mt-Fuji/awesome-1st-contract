- TVLとは
  - プロジェクト毎の「預け入れトークン数」に「現在価格(USD換算)」をかけ合わせた値
    - totalSupply
- Multiply the number of tokens deposited in a project by its current price in USD and you arrive at the project’s TVL. 
If a project accepts deposits in multiple tokens, one will have to calculate the TVL for each token and then add them up to get the TVL of the project.
